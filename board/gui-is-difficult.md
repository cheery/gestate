# gui-is-difficult — the ideas a GUI framework for gestate is built from, and the one that comes first

    status   doing
    because  "I think that GUI programming is extremely difficult.  For
             several reasons and one of them is that it's very visual.  I
             think I haven't solved it satisfactorily and it shows up
             every time when there's any kind of UI to make." — Henri,
             2026-09-07, after a gemba walk of the previous day's score
             box work.  "It's time to write a GUI framework for gestate.
             It's a difficult subject, so I am needed again to design
             critical parts of it."
    asked    Henri, 2026-09-07 — "Write these down… I think I want these
             all in."
    see      card:notes-editor.md — the day that showed it: 130 hands a
             box, an 85,000-character page, a five-second redraw
             card:drawn-scores.md — the roll this framework has to carry
             spec/substrate.md §"S3 — attachment, and the walk" — the pad
             the spec promised and the press that wrote one (F204)
             spec/north_star.md §"The vocabulary" — a gesture names what
             the file and the picture agree on
             doc/memory/henri-prior-tools.md — oscillseq, mide, xylem:
             each already answered one of these once
             doc/memory/gui-command-language-first.md — the rule below,
             as a memory

## What this is, what it is not, and when it runs

**A framework for the windows gestate draws** — the workbench's boxes,
the roll, the faders, whatever the score view becomes — built from a
short list of ideas each of which removes one reason GUI work is hard.
It is **not** a widget toolkit borrowed from elsewhere; `vision.md`
refuses borrowing another system's vocabulary to get power cheaply.
It is not the substrate, which stands and which most of the ideas
below are already partly true of.  And it is **not a session's to
design**: the critical parts are Henri's, by his own sentence, and
day one of this card is a dialogue, not code.

## The one that comes first, and must be stressed

**The command language and a clear model, before any picture.**
Henri, 2026-09-07: *"One thing I find important, that you already
listed: it's the command language and clear model before the GUI.
That's so important it must be stressed."*

Every gesture has a command under it, the command runs headless, the
transcript replays, and the picture is a way of issuing commands and
seeing the model — never the place the model lives.  The strongest
working examples: Tcl before Tk, where the toolkit was a command
language's front; Blender, where every button is a Python operator and
hovering shows its name; Emacs, where a key is a command with a
docstring; Plan 9's acme, where the text on screen *is* the command
line; AutoCAD's command line under every menu; Reaper's actions list;
and his own oscillseq, *everything has a command under it*.  This tree
has it most fully of all the ideas below — `transpose`, `carry`,
`select`, `bars`, `tempo` are what a drag runs when it lets go — and
it is the reason yesterday's rewrite of the hands cost the tests and
not the commands.

**Why it comes first.**  It is the only one of the ideas that makes
the others testable.  A picture as a function of state needs a state
to be a function of; hit-testing needs something to name what was
hit; a photograph as a test needs a command to have produced the
picture; a window that inspects itself needs a model to report.  Build
the picture first and the model is whatever the picture happens to
hold, which is the widget tree, which is the bug.

## Why it is hard — four things at once

1. **The oracle is an eye**, and an eye is not in the suite.
2. **Geometry is continuous** while code is discrete.
3. **A gesture is state spread across time**, from press to release.
4. **Two machines must agree**: the one that draws and the one that
   decides what a press hit.

Each idea below removes one of these.  Nobody has removed all four; the
best toolkits combine four or five of the ideas and still ship the
kind of defect F204 was.

## The ideas, each with why it is great and where the tree stands

*Session's list, 2026-09-07, from Henri's ask for "the best ideas for
building graphical user interfaces and why they're great ideas".*

1. **The picture is a function of the state, recomputed whole.**
   Immediate mode (Muratori, Dear ImGui), Elm, React.  Kills the
   retained widget tree that must be kept in sync with the model,
   where most GUI bugs live.  *Here:* the G-machine draws the roll
   from the file.  Yesterday's five seconds was this idea paid for the
   wrong way, through a recompile instead of a redraw.  *Its own hard
   part:* identity — which drawn thing is the same thing as last
   frame; F136's *244 of 291 notes jumped to a line not theirs* was an
   identity defect.
2. **Hit-testing derived from the same data that drew.**  The display
   list carries regions; a press asks the list.  What is visible is
   what is pressable, by construction.  Sketchpad, 1963.  *Here:*
   `Display::grabbed` and `gui._grabbed`, held to each other by
   parity; F204 was the hit side disagreeing with the draw side's
   spec, and the parity test is what caught it.
3. **A gesture writes nothing until it commits, and commits as a
   command.**  Press, drag, release as a state machine; the release
   runs a text command.  Undo is one entry, the transcript replays,
   the headless test drives the command not the mouse.  *Here:* most
   complete — §"The one that comes first".
4. **A tiny layout algebra.**  Over, Beside, Sized, Shift; box and
   glue; flexbox.  Composition without a class per widget; TeX showed
   the algebra plus one optimiser does a whole domain.  *Cost:*
   absolute arithmetic leaks in for what the algebra did not foresee
   — the roll's `Shift` sums.
5. **Constraints for the relationships the algebra cannot compose.**
   Cassowary, Auto Layout, xylem.  "This end stays at that end" is
   stated once and holds under resize.  *Cost:* an overconstrained
   system is worse to debug than arithmetic, so toolkits confine it to
   layout and keep it out of behaviour.
6. **Direct manipulation stated as four checkable properties.**
   Shneiderman: the object continuously visible; physical actions
   instead of syntax; operations rapid, incremental and reversible;
   the effect immediately visible.  Great because each is testable.
   *Here:* `card:notes-editor.md`'s postcondition is the fourth with
   a number on it.
7. **The window inspects itself.**  Morphic's halos, a browser's
   inspect element, Sketchpad's pick.  Press a thing and see its
   rect, its source line, its state; ask a pixel why it did not hit.
   The visual is the hard part and this makes the visual queryable.
   *Here:* half — a press says which line wrote the note.  The other
   half is missing, and the walk that produced this card could go
   through the code and not through the window.  **The session's
   candidate for the seam to open first.**
8. **A photograph is a test.**  Snapshot tests; `tools/driven.py`.
   The only honest oracle for visual is a picture, and a stored one
   compared is that oracle without the person.  Brittle, so hold few
   and hold structure elsewhere — the item-identical hit-table test is
   the structural form.
9. **One loop, one frame, inputs coalesced.**  The game loop.  Latency
   is a property of the loop, not the widgets.  *Here:*
   `doc/memory/gestate-editor-latency.md`, learned the hard way.
10. **Data, not generated program text.**  A picture is data produced
    by a program, and the program's size must not grow with the note
    count.  The page's 85,000 characters was codegen standing in for
    data; yesterday's 8,000 is the idea arriving.

## More from the session's memory, unsorted — to be questioned

*Offered 2026-09-07 at Henri's ask, "whatever you can find about GUI
development in your mind".  Each is a thing the session believes it
knows; none has been measured against this tree.  Strike freely.*

- **Modes are the enemy** (Tesler, Raskin's *Humane Interface*): a
  mode error is the user acting on a state they cannot see.  Raskin's
  quasimode — a mode held only while a key is down — is the honest
  form; Vim is the counterexample that works by making the mode the
  whole discipline.
- **Gesture recognisers as explicit state machines** (UIKit:
  possible, began, changed, ended, cancelled, failed) with declared
  exclusion between them.  The roll's press/band/resize/ruler are
  four recognisers written as `if` ladders today.
- **Statecharts** (Harel) for reactive systems — hierarchy and
  orthogonal regions, drawn.  The gesture machine above is one.
- **Identity by position versus identity by key** (React keys,
  SwiftUI's structural identity): the unsolved part of idea 1, and
  what provenance is.
- **The accessibility tree as the second proof a model exists**: if
  the UI cannot be walked by a screen reader, its structure was never
  named.
- **Gulf of execution and gulf of evaluation** (Norman): "very visual"
  is the evaluation gulf — the person cannot see what state the thing
  is in.  Affordances and feedback are the two repairs.
- **Fitts's law** — target size and distance predict acquisition
  time; edges and corners are infinitely tall.  An eight-pixel note
  end is a Fitts target.
- **The command palette** (Sublime, VS Code) and Emacs's
  `describe-key` — discoverability of a command language without a
  menu tree.  The natural front of idea 3.
- **Text as the interface** (Oberon, acme, Lilypond, TidalCycles,
  trackers like Renoise): a family where the model is a text and the
  picture is optional.  Gestate's `.notes` is already in it.
- **Zooming interfaces** (Pad++, Bederson): one continuous surface
  instead of windows.  A roll at the editing scale and the page at
  the compact one are two zoom levels written by hand.
- **Bidirectional editing / lenses** (Sketch-n-Sketch): edit the
  picture and the source changes, edit the source and the picture
  changes, both held to each other.  `transposed` writing the file
  back is one direction of a lens.
- **Damage rectangles versus full redraw**; double buffering; vsync
  — the mechanics under idea 9, and mostly settled.
- **Excel** as the most successful direct-manipulation programming
  environment ever shipped, and why: the model is a grid of formulas,
  the picture *is* the model, and every cell shows its value and can
  show its formula.
- **Xerox Star and the Canon Cat** — the two designs that started
  from a model of the *work* rather than of the screen.
- **Tufte's data-ink and small multiples**; Bertin's *Semiology*;
  Wilkinson's grammar (already read at the score box) — for the
  picture's *content*, not its plumbing.
- **Music-specific rooms:** Sibelius/Dorico (notation as a model with
  engraving rules), Ableton's clip grid, Bitwig, Max/MSP's patcher,
  SuperCollider's GUI as a language afterthought — each is a
  different answer to *what is the model*.

## Questions

*The session collected these on 2026-09-07; they are Henri's to answer.  He said he would ask
several of his own, and those go here too, dated, with the answers in
his words.*

1. **What is the model?**  Before any picture: the nouns a command
   line names.  Today they are the roll's events, the selection, the
   group, the section, the tempo.  Is that the model of the framework,
   or one client of it?
2. **What is the framework's own command language?**  The workbench
   has `Ctrl-K`; the roll has its verbs.  Does the framework own the
   verbs, or only the way a gesture reaches one?
3. **Which of the four hard things does he want removed first?**  The
   session's candidate is the eye (idea 7, the window inspecting
   itself); his may differ, and the card is ordered by his answer.
4. **Day one.**  What does a session do on the first sitting after
   the design?  If the answer needs a decision only he can make, this
   is a decision wearing a card, and it says so here rather than
   queueing.

## What a session does now

Ask, and write the answers in.  Not code.  Henri: *"I am needed again
to design critical parts of it.  Also, I'd like us to explore more."*
